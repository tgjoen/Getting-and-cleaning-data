##Data set information                                                                    
                                                                        
The dataset contains registrations from smartphone movement sensors

##Variables:

act_labels - what kind of activity (running, walking ect)
 
readings = list of all measurements (names of variables)

extract_mean_std = subset of data containing only mean and standard deviations

#Read files with data
x_test= raw data 

y_test= list of numbers from 1-6 indicating what kind od activity (walking, sitting ect)

subject_test = list of numbers denoting subjects upon which measurements were made in the test group

Activity_ID = column heading for y_test

Type_of_Activity = column heading for act_labels

test_data = data table were raw data and activity and persons have been merged
                                          
x_train = raw data for train group

y_train = list of numbers from 1-6 indicating what kind od activity (walking, sitting ect) for the train group


subject_train = ist of numbers denoting subjects upon which measurements were made in the train group


train_data = data table were raw data and activity and persons have been merged


data =  test and train data combined

id_labels = column headings

data_labels = column headings

all_data = all data combined with column headings


tidy_data = mean values of all data
